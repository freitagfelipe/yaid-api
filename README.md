# YAID API

-   This API was made to help [YAID](https://www.github.com/freitagfelipe/yaid), a Telegram bot created by me, and it's only used as a way of obtaining real links of Instagram posts and stories.

## How this API was made

-   This API is written in Typescript, using [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and other libraries like:
    -   [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
    -   [insta-fetcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insta-fetcher)
