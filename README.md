# YAID API

- This API was made to help [YAID](https://www.github.com/freitagfelipe/yaid), a Telegram bot created by me, and it is only used as a way of obtaining real links of Instagram posts and stories.

## How this API was made

- This API is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and these other libraries:
    - [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
    - [insta-fetcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/insta-fetcher)

## How it was implemented

- This API listen to the PORT 3000 by default if not specified in the .env file and have two main routes that only accept GET requests:
    - fetch-post
    - fetch-stories
- First, to hit one of these two routes the request pass by an auth middleware that checks if:
    1. The request has an authorization header
    1. The authorization header is equal to the TOKEN set in .env
- But before the request hits the respective GET controller, it will pass by a validator middleware that checks if:
    1. The request has an url or user in the query
    1. Checks, by using a regex, if the url is valid (only for fetch-post requests)
- Now finally the specific GET controller will execute by using the respective service that utilizes the InstagramAPI class, which applies the ideas from the monostate and [ObjectReadiness](https://pdconsec.net/blogs/devnull/asynchronous-constructor-design-pattern) design patterns to get the requested content. If everything works fine, it will return a 200 response with a JSON that contains an Result object:

```ts
interface Result {
    count: number;
    urls: string[];
}
```

- But the request can fails for some reasons:
    - If there is a fetch-post request:
        1. Fails with a 404 if the post does not exists or it is from a private account.
        1. Fails with 500 if something related to the internal service logic does not work as expected.
    - If there is a fetch-stories request:
        1. Fails with a 403 if the profile is private.
        1. Fails with a 404 if the service does not find the user or the user did not post any stories.
        1. Fails with 500 if something related to the internal service logic does not work as expected.
